About the dark mode app:

It reduces the brightness of your screen to reduce eye strain during night time use

Dark Mode can reduce the brightness of your screen lower than what you can achieve with the device's settings.
This application applies an overlay filter to darken the screen and ensure your eyes don't hurt if you are using the device in darkness.

To use the app:
- start the app
- click start
- a slider will appear
- move the slider until you are comfortable with the brightness level on your device
- enjoy!
